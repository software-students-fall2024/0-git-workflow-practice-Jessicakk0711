## What I find interesting about the article

**14. Suspicious Activity Tracker**  
This project outlines the development of an automated AI camera system that tracks suspicious activities to prevent unfortunate incidents in places like banks, malls, and airports. The system analyzes behavioral patterns and gestures from live camera feeds to identify potentially dangerous situations (e.g., fighting, pointing guns).

What fascinates me the most is the use of machine learning models to train cameras to detect such activities in real time. Additionally, the integration of automated alarms and notifications to nearby authorities adds a layer of immediacy and precision to prevent harmful incidents. The concept of combining AI with surveillance for proactive security measures shows the immense potential of technology in public safety.
